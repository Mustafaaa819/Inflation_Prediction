ðŸ“Š Inflation Prediction with Regression Models

This project is all about predicting inflation in Pakistan using different regression techniques.
Iâ€™ve tried Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression to see which one gives better and more accurate predictions.

ðŸš€ **Models Used**

1. Linear Regression
Straight line approach.
Easy to apply but inflation data is not always linear.
Works okay but not the best for this type of data.

2. Polynomial Regression
Tries to fit a curve instead of a straight line.
Captures ups and downs in the data better than linear.
Still not perfect when data is very irregular.

3. Random Forest Regression
Machine learning based.
Works with multiple decision trees and combines them.
Much better at handling non-linear patterns in inflation data.
Gave me the most accurate results compared to linear and polynomial.

ðŸ“‚ Files in This Project

inflation.csv â†’ dataset used.

inflation_prediction.py â†’ main Python code.

Graphs are generated inside the script.

ðŸ”® Results
Linear Regression: basic, not very accurate.
Polynomial Regression: better, fits the curve but still limited.
Random Forest Regression: most accurate, captures real patterns in inflation.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
Try more advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM).
Add more features (like oil prices, GDP, etc.) for even better accuracy.

ðŸ‘‰ Simple project, but shows how different regression models perform on real-world data like inflation.
